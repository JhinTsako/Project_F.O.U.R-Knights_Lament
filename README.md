# Project_F.O.U.R-Knights_Lament
A personal project I tinker in my free time learning C# and graphic design.

"Knight's Lament" is a 2D pixel art platformer game made in Unity and its a **WIP** project <br>
***As for now it has no specific storyline or anything of a gameplay, except a starting area and a main menu screen*** <br>

## Core
### Update 0.01 <br>
Fixed some minor graphical issues and updated some others
Added 1/3 Basic Attack Animations

Its been a while and I had no time to work on this unfortunately, next one is gonna be sooner (probably) <br>

### Feel free to check everything out!
***Note***<br>
Not every script or game object is made by myself here, but most if not all are modified heavily to my taste and testing my limits so it is a unique asset in the end!
